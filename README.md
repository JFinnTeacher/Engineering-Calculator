# Engineering-Calculator

Building on a program I created for a course I am doing My attempt to create a comprehensive series of calculators for use by engineering and technology students.

My Goals are initially

1. Utilise tkinter to create a graphical interface
2. include basic electronic claculators with graphical interface
   1. Ohms Law
   2. Resistors in Parallel and Series
   3. Resistor Colour Code Calculator
   4. LED protective resistor

Expansion Ideas to include

1. Gear Ratio/Velocity Ratio Calculator
   1. Simple Gear Train
   2. Compound Gears
2. Levers
   1. Principle of Moments Calculator
3. Stress Strain Diagram
   1. Draw Diagram
   2. Calcualate Youngs modulus
   3. Calculate .1% proof stress
   4. Calculate UTS
4. Thermal Equilibrium Diagram
   1. Calculate Ratio of Phases
